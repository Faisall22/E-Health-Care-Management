# E-Health-Care-Management
 
Medicare management tries to work on the following aspects:

● To optimize bed occupation.

● To improve the use of operation theaters.

● To know how emergencies affect the administration of the hospital departments or
services (cancellation of operations, etc).

● To optimize the allocation of human and material resources towards and shifts.

● To detect the influence of certain diseases in the hospital’s services.

● To find clusters of patients.



Integration of Corporate Medicare centers is very difficult while it is having different branches.

● In most of the cases the database is similar from one hospital to another hospital. In those cases also we can’t easily adapt a new technology in the new hospital.

● It is very difficult to analyze the usage percentage of hospital resources, Bed occupation Ratio, Administration, Laboratory information even in a single center. Then we can expect the complexity while integrating multi multi-specialty Medicare Centers.

● Room Reservations, Doctor Appointment Schedules, Operation Schedules, and Medicine indentation information is very difficult to maintain and share among the different Medicare Centers.

● Lack of generic and unique models we have to implement the same set of data models for every newly established Medicare Center.
